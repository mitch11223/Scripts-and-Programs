# Scripts-and-Programs
A collection of the scripts and programs I have written


App.R is the code for the rshiny app I have written accesible at the url: 'https://kingmitch11223.shinyapps.io/league/'
correlation.py is the code to scrape basketball-reference player and team gamelogs/splits, maniuplate it and output into a more human firendly way
speechrecognition.py is a script I developed to be able to interact with an OpenAI text-DaVinci-003 model through speech using the terminal and the Google Text to Speech API. (has some local dependiencies so probably wnot work anywhere apart from my computer)
AaronGordon.txt - ATL.txt - corr_file.txt are example outputs from correlation.py
